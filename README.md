# CrowdFunding-ETL

## Purpose of this Analysis
- The purpose of this analysis was to use Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks to extract and transform raw crowdfunding data given to us. Once the data was cleaned, it was loaded on sql to join and create database tables. 
- Using SQL, two table were created to allow the user to send an email to each contact of every live campaign and inform them of how much of the goal remains and also allow them to send an email to each backer and let them know how much of the goal remains for each live campaign theyâ€™ve pledged.
